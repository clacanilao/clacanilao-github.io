            Hi! My name is Clarence Lacanilao. I am a Business Information Technology student at Red River College Polytechnic. I'm interested
            in all things tech, gaming, video editing, networking, and creating connections with people who have the same interests as me. 
            <br>
            <br>
            I started liking technology ever since I joined cyber security in high school. My high school had big computer rooms with many dual 
            monitor workstations and a big server at the back of the room. I started to create networks, learn about PC components, and how to 
            build my own PC, which really piqued my interest in the IT industry. 
            <br>
            <br>
            On this webpage, you'll find more about me below in the Life Notes, as well as my <a href = "hobbies.html">hobbies</a> 
            section and my <a href = "skills.html">skills and work 
            showcase</a>. If you want to contact me, you can click <a href = "contactinfo.html">here</a> to go to the contact me tab.

                I have finished the final networking project. That means I'll have more time to work on my website. I'll try to make it look as 
                good as possible! Though I am not the greatest at web design.

            <p>
                Have had quite the cough these past few days, but I'm getting better the more time passes. I'm almost done with Term 2 of BIT! I 
                just need to finish 2 projects and assignments, and I have only 2 exams left from networking. Then it's Winter Break!

            <p>
                I finished all my personal assignments, just in time before the 2 big projects. It was a big hassle and I'm very tired, but I'm 
                glad they are all done. Now I can have more time to focus on those projects.

                I went to my first-ever Red River College Directions Conference! I met many of my college mates, instructors, staff, and IT 
                professionals who are in the industry. The conference was held in the RBC Convention Centre and was filled with many college 
                students from different fields of study.

                I switch my keyboards 2 times previously, and today is the third and last time I switch it. For being in IT, a good keyboard that 
                you can rely on is a necessity. The two previous keyboards I had didn't have a soft feel to them, and I kept getting fatigued even 
                after short periods of use. This MSI VIGOR GK71 SONIC keyboard is a perfect pickup for me because of its light actuation, media keys, 
                and flashy RGB design.
