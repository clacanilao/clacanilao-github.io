            I have had experience with networking since the beginning of high school. I have dealt with physical networks 
            that involve routers, switches, and end devices. I have also worked heavily on Packet Tracer networks and 
            can assemble and troubleshoot different types of networks both physically and on software.

        <p id = "databasep">
            Relational database skills are a skillset that I continue to build on. This skill set involves doing basic to 
            intermediate statements in SQL in both Data Definition Language (DDL) and Data Manipulation Language (DML). 
            I have learned things from basic select statements with WHERE clauses, all the way up to creating views with 
            subqueries and functions.

        <p class = "contentp">
            I am continuing to build on my Web Development Skills, even while creating this webpage! The things I have 
            learned vary from HTML/CSS skills to form validation on JavaScript, to the basics of using JSON from another
            website source. I have made an entire webpage from scratch by only looking at an image of a webpage
            and replicating the look of the webpage. I can do form validation for different types of inputs including text
            boxes, number inputs, radio buttons, and select forms. With creating webpages also comes web design, something
            I'm still not as good at my other web development skills, but I'm continuing to improve them day by day. Additionally,
            I have also added accessibility to my Hayden Planetarium webpage which makes it look way better.
